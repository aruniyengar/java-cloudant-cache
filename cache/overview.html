<body>

<P>
    This project provides functionality for using a local cache for Cloudant databases with the
    java-cloudant client.
</P>

<P>
    Caches implement the {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.Cache} interface (or one of its
    sub-interfaces). An example implementation is given in
    {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.LRUCache}, but the
    <a href="http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.cloudant/cloudant-client-in-process-cache/">
        cloudant-client-in-process-cache</a> and
    <a href="http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.cloudant/cloudant-client-redis-cache/">
        cloudant-client-redis-cache</a> projects provide alternative implementations.
</P>

<P>
    {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.DatabaseCache} and its sub-classes implement the java-cloudant
    client's {@link com.cloudant.client.api.Database} interface, preferentially using the cache and
    then delegating to the remote database.
</P>

<P>
    See the <a href="http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.cloudant/cloudant-client/">java-cloudant client
    javadoc</a> for more information about the client.
</P>
