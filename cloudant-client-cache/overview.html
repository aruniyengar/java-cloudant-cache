<P>
    This project provides functionality for using a local cache for Cloudant databases with the
    java-cloudant cloudant-client.
    By using client-side caching, data (that can be cached without violating consistency
    constraints) can be served directly from the client, eliminating the need to fetch the data from
    the server. This can considerably reduce the latency for data accesses.
</P>

<h1>Basics</h1>

<P>
    Caches implement the {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.Cache} interface (or one of its
    sub-interfaces). An example implementation is given in
    {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.LRUCache}, but the
    <a href="http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.cloudant/cloudant-client-cache-in-process/"
       target="_blank">
        cloudant-client-cache-in-process</a> and
    <a href="http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.cloudant/cloudant-client-cache-redis/" target="_blank">
        cloudant-client-cache-redis</a> projects provide alternative implementations.
</P>

<P>
    {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.DatabaseCache} and its sub-classes extend the java-cloudant
    client's {@link com.cloudant.client.api.Database} class, preferentially using the cache and
    then delegating to the remote database.
</P>
<pre>
    {@code
    // Instantiate a cache, in this example an LRUCache with a maximum capacity of 100 objects
    Cache<String, Object> cache = new LRUCache<>(100);

    // Get the Cloudant client instance and database object for the desired database.
    CloudantClient client = ClientBuilder.account("example").build();
    Database db = client.database("example-database", false);

    // Create a new DatabaseCache with the cache and your com.cloudant.client.api.Database
    // instance.
    Database cachedDb = new DatabaseCache(db, cache);
    // Use this cachedDb instance in place of your normal db instance to utilise the cache.
    // It may be worth keeping references to both the cached and un-cached instances if you want to
    // switch between cached and un-cached access to the database.

    // Example 1: Get document with ID "abcdef" from the cache if available, or from the database if
    // not yet cached.
    MyDocument abc = cachedDb.find(MyDocument.class, "abcdef");

    // Example 2: Use the original Database instance, db, to get document "abcdef" direct from the
    // remote database, bypassing the cache.
    MyDocument abc = db.find(MyDocument.class, "abcdef");
    }
</pre>

<P>
    See the <a href="http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.cloudant/cloudant-client/" target="_blank">

<h1>Cache types</h1>

<UL>
    <LI><b>In-process cache</b>

        <P>
            In-process caches store data within the process corresponding to the application. That
            way, there is no interprocess communication required for storing the data. For these
            implementations of in-process caches, Java objects can directly be cached. Data
            serialization is not required. In order to reduce overhead when the object is cached,
            the object (or a reference to it) can be stored directly in the cache. This means that
            changes to the object from the application could affect changes to the cached object
            itself. In order to prevent the value of a cached object from being modified by changes
            to the object being made in the application, a copy of the object can be made before the
            object is cached. This results in overhead for copying the object.

    <BR/>
    <LI><b>Remote process cache</b>

        <P>
            In this approach, the cache runs in one or more separate processes from the application.
            A remote process cache can run on a separate node from the application as well. There is
            some overhead for communication with a remote process cache. In addition, data often has
            to be serialized before being cached. However, remote process caches also have some
            advantages over in-process caches. A remote process cache can be shared by multiple
            clients, and this feature is often desirable. Remote process caches can often be scaled
            across multiple processes and nodes to handle high request rates and increase
            availability.

<h1>Guidance on document revisions</h1>

<P>
    The revision information from a cached object has the potential to be out-of-date or missing.
    The reasons for this are set out at length below, but it is preceded by the short version.
</P>

<h2>TL;DR version</h2>

<P>
    At the simplest level the revision token ({@code _rev} field) on objects retrieved using
    {@link com.cloudant.client.cache.DatabaseCache#find(java.lang.Class, java.lang.String)} may be
    obsolete or non-existent because the server side object may have been updated or the object was
    cached with no revision information.
    To get a suitable revision token for an update or a delete it is generally better to use
    {@link com.cloudant.client.api.Database#find(java.lang.Class, java.lang.String)} to bypass the
    cache or perform a HTTP HEAD request to get the document revision, which is returned in the
    {@code ETag} header field, without retrieving the entire document, for example:
</P>
<pre>
    {@code
    client.executeRequest(Http.HEAD(new URL(db.getDBUri().toString() + "/" + id)))
            .getConnection().getHeaderField("ETag");
    }
</pre>

<h2>Detailed version</h2>

<P>
    Object instances are added to the cache unmodified. This behaviour is consistent with the
    <a href="http://static.javadoc.io/com.cloudant/cloudant-client/2.3.0/overview-summary.html#Document%20revisions"
       target="_blank">behaviour of the java-cloudant client</a>, which does not modify objects
    after a write to the database. Consequently an object instance created from the deserialization
    of a document retrieved from the database will not be equal to the object instance that was
    saved because the server has added a revision token.
    It is the user's responsibility to retrieve and store the revision token when it is necessary
    for the application, for example to perform an update or delete.
    It is possible to set the retrieved revision token on a cached object reference to bring the
    cached instance up-to-date with the server document at that point in time.
</P>
<P>
    Here are some examples using the java-cloudant client alone or with the cache and the resulting
    revision token expectations.
</P>
<pre>
    {@code
    // Using java-cloudant only.

    // Create a new Foo with an _id, but no revision.
    Foo f = new Foo();
    // Save the foo in the Database.
    Response response = db.save(f);

    // This example assumes no further changes have been made to the database document.
    // Sometime later get the Foo from the database.
    Foo f2 = db.find(response.getId()); // Returns deserialized document from the database.

    f2.getRev().equals(response.getRev()); // True, f2 was deserialized from the database document
    f2.equals(f); // False, f has not been modified by the database write and has no revision set

    // Set revision on f
    f.setRev(response.getRev());
    f2.equals(f); // True as now f has the same revision as f2
    }
</pre>
<P>
    When using a java-cloudant-cache the attempt to retrieve an object can return the original
    object directly from the cache without deserializing a document from the database.
    This results in a behaviour difference from using java-cloudant alone.
</P>
<pre>
    {@code
    // Using a java-cloudant-cache.

    // Create a new Foo with an _id, but no revision.
    Foo f = new Foo();
    // Save the foo in the Database.
    Response response = cachedDb.save(f);

    // This example assumes no further changes have been made to the database document.
    // Sometime later get the Foo from the cached database.
    Foo f2 = cachedDb.find(response.getId()); // Returns the cached object.

    f2.getRev().equals(response.getRev()); // False, f2 has no revision information
    f2.equals(f); // True, neither f or f2 have a revision set (note f == f2 is also True)

    // Set revision on f
    f.setRev(response.getRev()); // Also updates the instance of f in the cache (and hence f2)
    f2.equals(f); // True, as before because f == f2 and both objects now have revision information.
    }
</pre>
<P>
    This behaviour difference is well defined, but can be confusing, particularly if using a cache
    with lifetimes that may purge expired objects from the cache. Consider this scenario.
</P>
<pre>
    {@code
    // Using a java-cloudant-cache with lifetimes.

    // Create a new Foo with an _id, but no revision.
    Foo f = new Foo();
    // Save the foo in the Database.
    Response response = lifetimeCachedDb.save(f);

    // This example assumes no further changes have been made to the database document.
    // Sometime later get the Foo from the cached database.
    Foo f2 = lifetimeCachedDb.find(response.getId()); // Returns the cached object.

    f2.getRev().equals(response.getRev()); // False, f2 has no revision information
    f2.equals(f); // True, neither f or f2 have a revision set (note f == f2 is also True)

    // Wait a while longer, until object expires in cache
    Foo f3 = lifetimeCachedDb.find(response.getId());
    // Expired so cache miss and object f3 is now deserialized from remote document
    f3.getRev().equals(response.getRev()); // True
    f3.equals(f); // False, f has no revision set

    // Note that the object returned from the same method call
    // lifetimeCachedDb.find(response.getId()) has different behaviour at different times because of
    // cache expiry.
    }
</pre>
<P>
    Setting the revision information after a write can to some extent provide more consistent
    behaviour.
</P>
<pre>
    {@code
    // Using a java-cloudant-cache with lifetimes.

    // Create a new Foo with an _id, but no revision.
    Foo f = new Foo();
    // Save the foo in the Database.
    Response response = lifetimeCachedDb.save(f);
    // Set the revision information
    f.setRev(response.getRev());

    // This example assumes no further changes have been made to the database document.
    // Sometime later get the Foo from the cached database.
    Foo f2 = lifetimeCachedDb.find(response.getId()); // Returns the cached object.

    f2.getRev().equals(response.getRev()); // True
    f2.equals(f); // True, f == f2

    // Wait a while longer, until object expires in cache
    Foo f3 = lifetimeCachedDb.find(response.getId());
    // Expired so cache miss and object f3 is now deserialized from remote document
    f3.getRev().equals(response.getRev()); // True
    f3.equals(f); // True, f and f3 have the same revision information
    }
</pre>
<P>
    However, all of these examples have considered only cases where the server side document has not
    changed. Depending on the application scenario documents on the server side might be updated
    from other sources. Since providing the latest revision information is a requirement for a
    successful update or delete operation some care must be taken. Generally an application should
    have appropriate mechanisms in place to handle the potential
    {@link com.cloudant.client.org.lightcouch.DocumentConflictException}s or to inspect the
    {@code error} field of each {@link com.cloudant.client.api.model.Response} for bulk operations.
